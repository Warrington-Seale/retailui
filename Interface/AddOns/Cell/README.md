<br>

A maintained fork of **Cell**, continued from **Krysio (krysiolol)** / jdtoppin, originally by **enderneko**.

Focused on Midnight compatibility, healer QoL, Classic/TBC support, and practical fixes that keep raid frames usable in modern WoW.

**Current version:** `r277.9.7.3`

# About This Fork

This repository is maintained by **NeRgY**.

Lineage:

1. [enderneko/Cell](https://github.com/enderneko/Cell) — original Cell
2. [jdtoppin/Cell](https://github.com/jdtoppin/Cell) — Skyking / intermediate fork
3. [krysiolol/Cell](https://github.com/krysiolol/Cell) — Krysio Midnight fork (`r277.7.5.3-krysio`)
4. **NeRgY** — continued from Krysio and extended further

Goals of this fork:

- Keep Cell working on **Retail Midnight (12.0.7)**
- If everything works well, create a version for **Season 2 (Patch 12.1.0)**.
- Improve **Classic Era / Hardcore** and **TBC Classic** usability
- Ship healer-focused QoL (Actions, Raid Debuffs, Import UX, options integration)
- Preserve Krysio's Midnight foundation while fixing regressions and filling gaps
- Stay practical: prefer stable, testable changes over experiments

> This is **NOT** the official Cell repository.

## NeRgY Fork Highlights (`r277.8.2`)

### Retail / Midnight

- **Hide Blizzard Party / Raid:** more stable, fewer errors in raids and alongside other addons
- **Solo power bars:** fixed a rare update error
- **Bar Animation → Smooth restored:** health and power bars animate smoothly again (Legacy stays immediate)
- **Out of Range Alpha:** frames correctly fade when out of range again (Retail + Classic)
- Built on Krysio's Midnight foundation (Secret Aura Fingerprint, HandleBuff, Aura Blacklist, Midnight Tools, Locale Override, Comm guards, Private Dispel work)
- Extra aura helpers (`Utils_Auras`) for safer timing/stacks/meta binding
- Party utilities updated for 12.0.7+ (`C_PartyInfo` ready check / role poll)
- **Indicators → Actions:** Midnight potion defaults  
  - Silvermoon Health Potion  
  - Light's Potential  
  - Existing profiles migrated automatically
- **Raid Debuffs:** Season 1 raids verified/updated  
  - The Voidspire  
  - The Dreamrift  
  - March on Quel'Danas  
  - Sporefall (Rotmire)

### Classic Era / TBC

- Clearer profile Import UX (errors, whitespace stripping, chat feedback)
- About Import moved up; Layouts Import warns on full-profile strings
- Fixed Import/About crashes when addon version metadata is missing
- **Out of Range Alpha fixed:** frames correctly fade when out of range again

### Options & UX

- Cell page under **Esc → Options → AddOns** (icon, version, credits, Open Options)
- Minimap button (left-click opens options, drag to move; toggle under General)

### Known limitations (Blizzard API)

- **Targeted Spells** remain internally disabled (same as Krysio)
- **Raid Debuffs** still work for **readable** spell IDs; true Private/Secret auras need the Private Auras indicator

# Philosophy

This fork prioritizes:

- healer usability
- modern WoW compatibility (especially Midnight)
- fixing real pain points (import, range, potions, raid debuffs)
- keeping Classic/TBC playable on the same codebase

Expect:

- behavior differences vs official Cell
- occasional breaking changes after Blizzard API updates
- features that may stay fork-only

---
