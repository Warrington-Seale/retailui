-- HDGR_DestroyQueue.lua -- the ONE destroy path for stored decor copies. The
-- Decor tab's destroy dialog and the browser's Ctrl-Shift-click both run here.
--
-- WHY THE TOTAL (live 12.1, 2026-09-19). The client takes every destroy off its
-- stored count at once, kept or not, until /reload, and nothing in the API
-- reports a refusal. What does tell is the item's owned TOTAL (stored + placed +
-- redeemable): the client holds it at the server's figure and papers the gap
-- with a temporary rise in "placed" (HousingCatalogObserver:OwnedTotal). So a
-- copy counts as destroyed only when the total falls, and the on-screen count is
-- always what the server took.
--
-- THE SERVER PAUSES. It takes a burst of destroys, then drops the rest without a
-- word (live 12.1, 2026-09-19: three paced runs of 101 each stopped landing at
-- 26-28). Dropped destroys never land -- each next run started from exactly the
-- total the last one reported. So when nothing lands for DESTROY_DROP_SECS the
-- run writes off what was in flight, waits DESTROY_RETRY_SECS, and sends one
-- destroy at a time until the server takes one again, then goes back to full
-- pace. DESTROY_RETRY_LIMIT tries in a row with nothing landing ends the run.
--
-- PACING: at most DESTROY_IN_FLIGHT_MAX destroys wait on the server at once; the
-- next goes out when the total confirms one.
--
-- STOP drains: nothing new is sent, but destroys already on their way can still
-- land, so the run waits for them (or DESTROY_DROP_SECS) before it reports. A
-- call that throws winds the run down the same way.
--
-- The run's own bookkeeping lives here, like HDGR_BuyQueue's; the Store gets
-- the part the UI shows (DECOR_DESTROY_PROGRESS -> session.destroying).
