-- HDGR_Selectors_Blueprints.lua
-- ============================================================================
-- Pure selectors for the Blueprints tab.
--
-- NOTE the near-collision: `session.blueprints.available` is a SERVER-derived
-- fact (BLUEPRINT_AVAILABLE_SET) about whether the blueprint system is usable.
-- The retired `blueprints.available` SELECTOR was something else entirely -- a
-- client-build capability gate for the nav child, which HDG no longer needs now
-- that the TOC is 12.1-only. Do not resurrect the name for either job.

local Selectors = HDG.Selectors

local CT_LABEL = { [1] = "House", [2] = "Room", [3] = "Decor", [4] = "Dye", [5] = "Fixture" }

-- Per-entry acquisition resolve. Plain local helper -- Selectors:Call passes
-- NO extra args, so per-item lookups never route through the registry. Catalog
-- access is the sanctioned live-facade pattern (ADR-003a); reactivity comes
-- from the session.resolvers.catalog.tick read on the registered selector.
-- Returns: itemID?, srcKind? (SOURCE_KINDS key for Format.SourceChip), srcName?
-- The recordID -> itemID join lives on the CATALOG (ItemIDForEntry), because a
-- second caller appeared for it -- the public API another Vamoose addon routes
-- a shopping list through. Two copies of a join is how the two quietly start
-- disagreeing about what a manifest entry means.
--
-- What stays here is the part the chips need and the API does not: which SOURCE
-- the row came from, and what to call it.
-- preferredMapID (optional): re-pick the VENDOR line for one neighborhood
-- instead of using the baked one. The bake is preference-free by necessity --
-- one row serves every player -- so an export written for a particular
-- neighborhood has to ask again here. Every other source kind is
-- neighborhood-independent and comes straight off the row.

    -- A dye with no catalog row still routes -- its recordID IS the item ID --
    -- but there is nothing to hang a source chip on.

-- unscannable -- the dye group alone reads Purple, Red, Blue, Black, White,
-- Brown, Green. Sorted by name for reading (asked for by madaileinhatter,
-- 2026-08-20).
--
-- recordID breaks ties so the order is TOTAL: table.sort is not stable, and two
-- entries can share a name (dyed variants), so without the tie-break their
-- relative order could differ between repaints and churn the scrollbox keys.
--
-- Returns a COPY. Sorting m.raw.contentGroups in place would have a selector
-- mutating stored state.

-- have / need for one manifest entry. Decor takes the server's figures.
--
-- DYES DO NOT. The server's numMissing for a dye only covers decor the target
-- house already has, and counts only dyes in your bags, so it climbs as the
-- build's decor is bought: 35 orange became 75 after 40 undyed pillars
-- (Windgrace90, Reddit 2026-09-19). Live-probed the same day: a 792-piece gap
-- read Red 141 total / 61 need with 1 in bags. The manifest never says which
-- dye goes on which piece, so the one figure that holds still is the build's
-- total against what you HOLD, across bags and every bank. `have` is capped at
-- the total so the pair reads as coverage, the way decor's does.
-- Known overstatement: dyes already on decor placed in the target house are
-- inside the total too, so re-inspecting a build that is already up can ask
-- for dyes it does not need. The row tooltip says so.
-- Returns have, need, and for dyes held + the bag share of it: the row tooltip
-- sets HDG's reading beside the server's, and the bag share is the one number
-- an import can actually spend.

-- The inspector envelope: manifest -> rendered groups with acquisition joins.
-- nil when nothing is selected; a groupless envelope while pending/failed.
-- missingCount counts ACQUIRABLE entries (Decor=3/Dye=4) with need>0 --
-- fixtures/rooms/house types can't be routed or bought, so the number the
-- verdict shows matches what Route to Shopping actually adds (UX review #5).
-- missingTotal is the PIECE sum of need over that same set: a blueprint
-- with six planters missing is one entry but six pieces, and the headline the
-- player reads as "how much do I still have to get" has to be the pieces
-- (Soul, Discord 2026-09-10). Per-group header counts still cover every type.

-- ===== Cost to build =========================================================
-- "Can I afford this blueprint?", beside "does it fit?". Asked for by
-- Madailein Hatter (Discord 2026-08-04): people pass up a share code because the
-- commitment is invisible until they are already committed.
--
-- Prices the ACQUISITION GAP, not the whole build -- what you still need, at
-- need each. Only Decor(3)/Dye(4) can be bought; rooms and fixtures are
-- structural, which is the same set blueprints.inspector counts as missing.
--
-- A CURRENCY summary, not a gold total (owner ruling): housing decor is sold for
-- several currencies and some item tokens, so each keeps its own running total
-- and gold is just another line. Costs come from the catalog's baked
-- row.costEntries (currency or item-token entries, grouped by Format.CostKey)
-- -- no vendor-DB join needed.
--
-- unpricedCount is carried, not swallowed. A total that silently drops the
-- entries it could not price reads as authoritative while being wrong; one that
-- says "12 of 47 unpriced" is honest about what it knows.
--
-- KNOWN LIMIT: row.costEntries is the FIRST vendor block's cost. Components
-- within it are ANDed (100g + 5 coupons) and summing them is right, but where an
-- item is sold "30 coupons OR 500g" the alternatives live in separate vendor
-- blocks (row.costVariants) and this counts whichever vendor is listed first.
-- So the badge is "a price to build", not "the cheapest price to build".
